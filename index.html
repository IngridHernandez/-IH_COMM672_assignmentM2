        <h1><bold>Tamales</bold></h1>
        <p>These <mark>tamales</mark> are delicious! I have been looking for a good <i>tamales</i> recipe for years. One day I went to the international market and stood in the Mexican aisle until a woman with a full cart came by. I just asked her if she knew how to make tamales. This is her recipe with rice and beans.</p>
        <ol>
           <li>Cook the pork.</li> 
           <li>Make the sauce.</li>
           <li>Mix the pork with Â½ of the sauce.</li>
           <li>Soak the husks and make the dough.</li>
           <li>Spread the dough over the dried husks.</li>
           <li>Dollop the filling onto the dough.</li>
           <li>Fold the tamales.</li>
           <li>Steam the tamales.</li>
           <li>Remove the husks.</li>
           <li> Top with the sauce and sour cream (or mix them together for a creamy sauce).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><bold>Rice</bold></h2>
        <p>When serving tamales for dinner, choosing complementary side dishes can guarantee an elevated meal. <mark>Mexican rice</mark>, with its rich flavors and vibrant colors, pairs beautifully with <i>tamales</i>.</p>
